  <h2>Religious Tour

  <p>There are essentials to tick off when sightseeing in Jaipur –  the front facade of Hawa Mahal, a tour of Amber Fort, shopping for textiles, jewellery and handicrafts in the bazaars (markets), etc. But those places would only be scratching the surface of Jaipur.

     The capital of the state of Rajasthan in India has so much colour and history to offer. Walk down the bylanes of the Old City, pause to admire the architecture of old buildings and tread up the cobbled paths of its forts.</p>
